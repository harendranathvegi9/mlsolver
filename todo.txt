MLSolver TODO:
- Real literal propagation requires serious changes (dynamic formulas, dynamic ordering, automatic updating of automata sets etc.)
- Transforming formulas poses difficulties for automata and associated determinization procedures (needs to know size).
- Modularity of determinisation procedures
- Optimization on / off
- Serious option module
- Uniform syntax of formulas?
